## Insight / Challenge

Even though Iâ€™m confident in my web development skills, it had been a while since I last worked on a complete project, my recent focus was on Flutter mobile apps. Implementing this tech stack required brushing up on several frameworks and tools, which took a few days and a lot of patience. Additionally, this was my first time successfully integrating Firebase Authentication into a website, having only done it in mobile applications before. This experience was a valuable learning moment and helped me grow across the full stack confidently.
